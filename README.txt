Matching Game Project:

Using html, css, and javascript (jQuery) I've made a dynamic card matching memory game
that can be played in your browser. Just open the index.html document in your
favorite browser.

Included in this folder:

index.html:
  single-page website
style.css:
  style sheet for that website
index.js:
  javascript for that website

# Match Me!
A fun card matching game to test your memory. Can you reveal all the cards
and keep a 3 star rating?

### How to Play:
* Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
* Click the start button on the popup that loads.
* Click on any one of the purple card backs you see in the grid.
* Click on a second one!
* Repeat until all the images are revealed.

### Things to know:
* Timer doesn't affect your star rating, it's just some helpful information!
* Star rating is determined by move counter.
* You can restart the game at any time with the provided restart button.

### Known Bugs:
To my knowledge there's currently only one bug, a minor visual issue that
appears after the game is started, where the `<div>` containers holding the
card `<img>`s increase in size once on rollover. This issue does not persist
through in-game restarts, and happens most noticeably in Chrome, though it appears
to occur in Safari at certain window sizes.
